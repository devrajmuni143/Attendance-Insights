# Employee Working Preferences and Health Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction
The Employee Working Preferences and Health Analysis Dashboard aims to provide insights into the working patterns of employees, focusing on attendance, work-from-home preferences, and sick leave trends. The dashboard is designed to help HR identify potential issues and optimize employee well-being.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze working preferences**: Understand the distribution of employees working in the office versus those working from home.
2. **Identify sick leave trends**: Investigate patterns of sick leave to determine if there are recurring health issues among employees.

## Data Sources
The primary data source for this analysis is the Attendance worksheet provided by the HR department. The dataset includes information on employee attendance, work-from-home days, and sick leave records.

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard comprises key components such as:
- Total Working days
- Total Present days
- Total Work-from-home days
- Total Sick leaves
- Attendance percentage
- Work-from-home percentage
- Sick leave percentage
- Days of the Week analysis

## Key Metrics
1. **Attendance %**: Calculated as the ratio of total present days to total working days, indicating overall attendance performance.
2. **WFH %**: Reflects the percentage of total work-from-home days, helping to understand the prevalence of remote work.
3. **SL % (Sick Leave %)**: Provides insights into the proportion of sick leave days relative to total working days.

## User Interactivity
Users can interact with the dashboard by exploring different time frames and drilling down into specific days of the week. Slicers and filters allow for a customized view of attendance, work-from-home, and sick leave metrics.

## Findings
1. Presence percentage shows a slight decrease over time.
2. Work-from-home percentage is increasing, particularly on Thursdays and Fridays.
3. Sick leave percentage is not alarming, but there is a noticeable trend of higher sick leave on Mondays and Tuesdays.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate factors contributing to the decrease in presence percentage.
2. Explore reasons behind the increasing preference for work from home, especially on Thursdays and Fridays.
3. Address the trend of higher sick leave on Mondays and Tuesdays; consider wellness programs or health initiatives.
